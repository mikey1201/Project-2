Project 2: Pairs Olympic Games Single Page Website
Objective: Create a single-page website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase information about the Pairs Olympic Games, including medal rankings, sports schedules, and current news updates.
Requirements:
HTML Structure:
Basic Structure: Create an index.html file with appropriate HTML5 structure.
Header Section: Include a header with the title "Pairs Olympic Games" and possibly a logo or introductory image related to the games.
Navigation Menu: Implement a navigation menu with links to different sections of the page (e.g., Home, Medal Rankings, Sports, News).
Main Content Sections:
Medal Rankings: Display the top 10 countries with their respective medal counts (gold, silver, bronze).
Sports List: Provide a list of at least 5 sports featured in the Pairs Olympic Games, clickable to view their schedules.
News Section: Include a section for displaying hot news updates related to the games.
CSS Styling:
External Stylesheet: Create a styles.css file and link it to index.html.
Design and Layout: Design a visually appealing layout using CSS:
Ensure consistent styling across all sections (medal rankings, sports list, news).
Use appropriate fonts, colors, and spacing to enhance readability and user experience.
Implement responsive design principles to ensure the website looks good on different screen sizes.
JavaScript Functionality:
External JavaScript File: Create a script.js file and link it to index.html.
Interactive Features: Enhance user interaction with JavaScript:
Implement functionality to fetch and display real-time medal rankings (you can use mock data or APIs like Olympic data APIs if available).
Enable clickable sports links to display schedules (you can simulate this with sample data or static content).
Display hot news updates dynamically (you can simulate this with sample news content).
Content:
Medal Rankings: Populate this section with static or mock data showing the top 10 countries and their medal counts.
Sports List: Include at least 5 sports with links or buttons leading to schedules (static or mock schedules can be used).
News Section: Display at least 2-3 current news headlines related to the Pairs Olympic Games (use placeholder text or static content).
Additional Considerations:
Validation: Validate HTML and CSS to ensure clean and error-free code.
Testing: Test the website across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure compatibility.
Documentation: Include a brief README.md file in the project repository describing the project overview, technologies used, and any special instructions for running or viewing the website.
Submission:
Submit the project as a GitHub repository link .
Evaluation Criteria:
Adherence to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript best practices.
Visual design and layout quality.
Functionality and interactivity of implemented features (medal rankings, sports schedules, news updates).
Completeness and accuracy of content related to the Pairs Olympic Games.
Note:
Encourage creativity in design while meeting the assignment requirements.
Students can use placeholder data or mock content where real-time data or APIs are not available.
Ensure all work is original and properly attributed if using external resources or libraries.
